# android-mvp-sample

This sample is a simple demonstration of Mvp pattern done by me, without external libs to understand the concept of this pattern.

Basically the user make a request, the Presenter receive that interaction then update the view
with data from Model.

With that we remove all logic in View layer, making an app better for tests, let it readable and separated into layers.
