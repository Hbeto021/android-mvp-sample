# android-mvp-sample

This sample is a simple demonstration of Mvp pattern done by me, without external libs to understand the concept of this pattern.

Basically the user make a request, the Presenter receive this request, make all necessary logics and update the view
according to what the user requested.

With that we remove all the business and validation logic from View, making an app better for tests, readable and clean.
